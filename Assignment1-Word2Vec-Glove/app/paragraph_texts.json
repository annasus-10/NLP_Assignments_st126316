["ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT\n  Mounting trade friction between the\n  U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting\n  nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic\n  damage, businessmen and officials said.\n      They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.\n  Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the\n  U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.\n      But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt\n  them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be\n  their gain.\n      The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on\n  imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in\n  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not\n  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.\n      Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs\n  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms\n  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the\n  new taxes.\n      \"We wouldn't be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for\n  leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric\n  Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.\n      \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time\n  beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of\n  exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom\n  Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James\n  Capel and Co>.\n      In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.\n      \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against\n  Japan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior\n  Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.\n      Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last\n  year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.\n      The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves\n  to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.\n      \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and\n  cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we\n  want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said\n  Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.\n      A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion\n  association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan\n  might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports\n  are similar to those of Japan.\n      Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion\n  dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.\n      In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough\n  curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of\n  semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the\n  U.S.\n      In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been\n  selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics\n  manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such\n  a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by\n  further U.S. Pressure to block imports.\n      \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills,\n  director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.\n      \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will\n  be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong\n  is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.\n      The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,\n  accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.\n      The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade\n  talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,\n  Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.\n      \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two\n  countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very\n  serious matter,\" Button said.\n      He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,\n  Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant\n  U.S. Exports to that country.\n      Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the\n  trade stand-off continue.\n      Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined\n  a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.\n      The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget\n  and record public works spending in the first half of the\n  financial year.\n      They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency\n  measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister\n  Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.\n      Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto\n  Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and\n  Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an\n  effort to end the dispute.", "CHINA DAILY SAYS VERMIN EAT 7-12 PCT GRAIN STOCKS\n  A survey of 19 provinces and seven cities\n  showed vermin consume between seven and 12 pct of China's grain\n  stocks, the China Daily said.\n      It also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes, or 25 pct, of\n  China's fruit output are left to rot, and 2.1 mln tonnes, or up\n  to 30 pct, of its vegetables. The paper blamed the waste on\n  inadequate storage and bad preservation methods.\n      It said the government had launched a national programme to\n  reduce waste, calling for improved technology in storage and\n  preservation, and greater production of additives.

Thailand's improved business climate this\n  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials\n  and semi-finished products.\n      The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the\n  first quarter due to lower oil prices.\n      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6\n  billion baht from 56.6 billion.\n      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower\n  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose\n  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26\n  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.\n      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up\n  64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.", "INDONESIA SEES CPO PRICE RISING SHARPLY\n  Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO)\n  prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB\n  sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall\n  in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree\n  crops, told Indonesian reporters.\n      Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332\n  dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.\n      Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite\n  making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it\n  could possibly increase its international market share.\n      Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil\n  after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure\n  supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.\n      Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary\n  shortage than to lose export markets.\n      Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500\n  tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank\n  figures.", "AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT\n  Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),\n  Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on\n  foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still\n  being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.\n      The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented\n  the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.\n      The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration\n  Commission today.\n      Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the\n  ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.\n      The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week\n  of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to\n  protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.\n      The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to\n  be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of\n  each shift and then to walk off.\n      Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with\n  container movements most affected, but has not stopped\n  altogether, they said.\n      They said they could not say how long the disruption will\n  go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.", "INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND\n  The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is\n  likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and\n  possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian\n  Nainggolan said.\n      He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in\n  palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.\n      Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil\n  may also be introduced. But he said the question was still\n  being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no\n  decision on when to go ahead had been made.\n      The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber\n  physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.\n      \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said.\n  \"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a\n  mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\"\n      Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee\n  added in January 1986.

Others argue the merger\n  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\n  network from scratch.\n      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has\n  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\n  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\n  wisdom of some of those moves.\n      \"They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\n  it's largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\n  financial analyst Simon Smithson.\n      Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to\n  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\n  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\n  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\n  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\n  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\n      \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\n  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.\n      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\n      \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\n  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\n  years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.\n      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\n  into the securities business at home.\n      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's\n  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\n  from investment banking.\n      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\n  said he hopes further deregulation will create new\n  opportunities.\n      \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some\n  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\n  bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.\"\n      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\n  domestic securities business as profitable government bond\n  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\n  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\n  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\n  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\n  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\n  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\n  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\n  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n      \"We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\n  in two or three years,\" he said.\n      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\n  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\n  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\n      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\n  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\n  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\n      \"It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said\n  Kleinwort's Smithson.\n      \"After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling\n  around. It will be the next decade before we see if the\n  strategy is right or wrong.\"", "SUBROTO SAYS INDONESIA SUPPORTS TIN PACT EXTENSION\n  Mines and Energy Minister Subroto\n  confirmed Indonesian support for an extension of the sixth\n  International Tin Agreement (ITA), but said a new pact was not\n  necessary.\n      Asked by Reuters to clarify his statement on Monday in\n  which he said the pact should be allowed to lapse, Subroto said\n  Indonesia was ready to back extension of the ITA.\n      \"We can support extension of the sixth agreement,\" he said.\n  \"But a seventh accord we believe to be unnecessary.\"\n      The sixth ITA will expire at the end of June unless a\n  two-thirds majority of members vote for an extension.", "BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.1 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER\n  The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1\n  billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities\n  repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank\n  spokesman said.\n      Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,\n  will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy\n  back securities pledged on May 6.\n      Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as\n  an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively\n  withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with\n  today's allocation.\n      A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the\n  withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit\n  policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful\n  liquidity in the banking system.\n      Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank\n  over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely\n  April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.\n      The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2\n  billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks\n  themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.\n      Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much\n  liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the\n  effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main\n  open-market instrument for steering market interest rates.

The surplus enabled the\n  country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first\n  time.\n      South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs\n  in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest\n  in Asia.\n      \"This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the\n  major constraints on our development... Last year was a major\n  turning point for the Korean economy,\" Kim said.\n      Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of\n  foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from\n  about 50 pct in 1986.\n      \"The government, however, does not want to accelerate\n  reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,\" he\n  said.\n      Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation\n  and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,\n  particularly the United States.\n      \"We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but\n  we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a\n  proper level,\" Kim said.", "FINNS AND CANADIANS TO STUDY MTBE PRODUCTION PLANT\n  Finland's national oil company Neste Oy\n  &lt;NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms\n  to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,\n  Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.\n      The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln\n  Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether\n  (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.\n      The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada\n  Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line\n  Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.\n      The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials\n  availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the\n  important capital and operating advantages gained by locating\n  on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.\n      The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant\n  producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer\n  that can replace tetra ethyl lead.\n      Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States\n  where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of\n  health concerns, the statement added.\n      Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the\n  U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in\n  Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,\n  it said.\n      Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five\n  billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE.

Some of that is ending\n  up here with the attraction of high interest rates and\n  reasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd\n  economist Brian Hamley said.\n      \"There is a 'flight to quality',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may\n  not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too\n  many other countries where you'd want to put your money.\"\n      The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting\n  investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against\n  the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.\n      \"We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.\n  Where some people would be concerned about the value of the\n  U.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose\n  said. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap\n  and the currency looks stable?\"\n      But turning that capital into more permanent productive\n  investment depends on government economic policy, he said.\n      \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the\n  direction in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore\n  investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough\n  economic statement on May 14.\n      While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding\n  interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as\n  easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were\n  badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar\n  and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\n      \"It will remain very edgy money.

But the government has repeatedly said it\n  will not allow any banks to go under.\n      The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of\n  problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether\n  debtors have regular cash flows or not.\n      Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights\n  guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance\n  in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector\n  is the biggest after oil.\n      Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride\n  out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.\n      Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)\n  compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last\n  year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.\n      But strategic diversification into downstream operations in\n  Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at\n  home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell\n  over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.\n      Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average\n  2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed\n  product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as\n  crude.\n      Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason\n  for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic\n  inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent\n  years and signs government spending on productive sectors will\n  remain steady.\n      External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8\n  billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below\n  that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit\n  Gulf.\n      Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put\n  officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income\n  of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.\n      But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these\n  reserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for\n  the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.\n      In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,\n  revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,\n  doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.\n      This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded\n  in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at\n  up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some\n  shortfall.\n      Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for\n  economic growth this year or next.\n      \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is\n  important.\"\n      Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday\n  the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state\n  spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the\n  economy.\n      He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be\n  spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.", "MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET\n  Malaysia is unlikely to meet its\n  targeted output of five mln tonnes of

back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut\n  Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources\n  in the Philippine food and brewery company said.\n      A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB\n  from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's\n  outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on\n  April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former\n  chairman of both SMC and UCPB.\n      Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)\n  and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.\n      Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and\n  represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's\n  plans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of\n  fiduciary duties.\"\n      The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be\n  held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities\n  and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a\n  government nominee on the company's board.\n      De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,\n  asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by\n  the company's board.\n      On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the\n  sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per\n  share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained\n  earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the\n  purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of\n  dividends.\n      De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate\n  an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt\n  to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon\n  del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would\n  boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.\n      In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier\n  suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres\n  Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.\n      De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming\n  last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong\n  subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.\n  The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board\n  meeting.\n      An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to\n  resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by\n  April 15.\n      \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of\n  a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard\n  of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early\n  disposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in\n  a statement.\n      \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have\n  reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of\n  payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the\n  government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement\n  of the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added.\n      A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on\n  Cojuangco's court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from\n  us might be interpreted as adversarial.\"\n      Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which\n  sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible\n  to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United\n  States citizen.\n      The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares,\n  which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which\n  are available to foreign buyers.\n      SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among\n  prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by\n  the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed\n  institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers\n  in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.\n      The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on\n  Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were\n  owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President\n  Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the\n  U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend\n  announced last June.\n      \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz\n  told Reuters. \"But everything is on hold now.\"\n      The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy\n  would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'\n  meeting, scheduled for May 14.\n      San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion\n  pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in\n  1985.

legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of\n  corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.\n      Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,\n  Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased\n  the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.\n      \"We are proposing legislation that would provide for more\n  disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would\n  insure that takeovers are properly financed,\" he said.\n      Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold\n  for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a\n  investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a\n  company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within\n  10 days, Proxmire said.\n      In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement\n  that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have\n  to filed with the SEC.\n      Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to\n  prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in\n  knowing about coming takeover attempts.\n      Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a\n  tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60\n  business days from the current 20 business days.\n      His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring\n  company violated the time period on the tender offer.\n      To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire\n  said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin\n  requirments are properly enforced.\n      The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement\n  for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally\n  enforced in hostile takeovers.\n      Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover\n  declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without\n  actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.\n      He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for\n  failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin\n  requirements.\n      The bill also would require more disclose when several\n  investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.\n      \"When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know\n  about it,\" Proxmire said.\n      Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain\n  towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all\n  shareholders recieve equal treatment.\n      He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover\n  defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.\n

The whole game is bringing out new products and improving\n  the old ones.\"\n      Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,\n  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of\n  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.\n      U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about\n  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike\n  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,\n  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand\n  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up\n  by as much as 300 pct, he said.\n      Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in\n  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned\n  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its\n  history.\n      In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel\n  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.\n  dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entire\n  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\"\n  Oreffice said.\n      GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical\n  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.\n  Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion\n  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.\n      The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical\n  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and\n  planning, said Pace's John Dosher.\n      Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks\n  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar\n  was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost\n  U.S. chemical exports.\n      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has\n  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical\n  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers\n  in the early 1980s.\n      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers\n  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program\n  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate\n  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of\n  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.\n      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\n  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs\n  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\n  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> \n  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\n  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\n      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\n  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\n  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\n  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\n  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\n      \"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the\n  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\n  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\n  deteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually\n  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\n  market.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.\n      \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\n  carried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF's Heyman\n  cautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be\n  ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\"\n      Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the\n  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700\n  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.\n      Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout\n  of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1\n  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants\n  along the Texas Gulf Coast.\n      The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that\n  are the building blocks of specialty products.\n      \"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a\n  glamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demand\n  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.\n      Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\n  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for\n  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood\n  and steel products.

Dominion has said that it\n  was looking for a takeover in the U.S.\n      Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills\n  and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for\n  a U.S. acquisition.\n      A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer\n  has been negotiating with \"many\" U.S. textile companies, but\n  would not say whether Burlington was among them.\n      \"There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not\n  unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the\n  housecleaning they've done,\" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson\n  McKinnon.\n      Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets\n  and other linens, to J.P.

It also has reorganized management, and focused its\n  operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign\n  competition, Gormley said.\n      \"They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,\"\n  said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial\n  fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets\n  and other fabric to the auto industry.\n      \"In the past, they just spent and never realized the return\n  on the outlays they did make,\" she said.\n      \"You look at their record over the year, and I think\n  they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the\n  past,\" Gormley said.\n       She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up\n  from 2.01 dlrs per share.\n      Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington\n  at its current levels.\n      Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends\n  selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50\n  dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings\n  basis.\n      Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been\n  placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.\n      \"After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people\n  don't find him very credible anymore,\" said one arbitrager.\n      Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing\n  managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if\n  he doesn't win the target company.\n      Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky\n  Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp.

The\n  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\n  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n      Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit\n  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\n  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\n  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\n  into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer\n  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\n  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\n  point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\n  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n      \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\n  market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\n  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\n  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\n  regionalized.\n       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\n  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\n  important beer growth markets in the long term.\n       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\n  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\n  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\n  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\n  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n  1986 sales.\n      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\n  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\n  have been looking at other possibilities.\n      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\n  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\n  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\n  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\n  popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\n  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\n      Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to\n  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\n  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's\n  market potential.

warned.\n      He said \"we at the Federal Reserve will have to be\n  disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy.\" \n      Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal\n  discipline

material, human spit,\n  chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow\n  their noses.\"\n      Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture\n  Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended\n  the government's program, calling it \"one of the most respected\n  public health programs in the world.\"\n      FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5\n  billion chicken and turkeys every year.\n      Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with\n  change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in\n  the meat and poultry supply has increased.\n      He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium\n  salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time\n  and much money to contain the growing problem.\n      Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is\n  found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw\n  pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.\n      The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20\n  years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.\n      \"We certainly really have not found an effective means of\n  turning this disease around,\" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)\n      The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS\n  intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for\n  detecting microoganisms.\n      But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls\n  would cost too much.\n      \"Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily\n  complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real\n  goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and\n  economical meat supply for consumers,\" Stanley Emerling,\n  executive vice president of the National Association of Meat\n  Purveyors, said.\n      Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new\n  program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at\n  certain plants \"voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be\n  repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic\n  of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor\n  legal recourse.\"\n      Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the\n  panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.", "CHRYSLER &lt;C> RENAULT DELAY AM MOTORS &lt;AMO> PACT\n  Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des\n  Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks\n  the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler's\n  proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.\n      The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on\n  March nine set April nine as the target date for completing\n  negotiations.\n      However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of\n  that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.\n      The two companies said they \"now plan to complete work by\n  April 23.\"\n      Chrysler and Renault said, \"Given the complex nature of the\n  deal, the need for additional time was to be expected.\"\n      The March letter of intent between the two companies says\n  that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date\n  \"in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers\n  an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'\n  investigation of the company,\" referring to American Motors.\n      A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem\n  had cropped up in the talks.

But Volcker\n  has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught\n  with danger.\n      Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as\n  imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign\n  capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.\n      In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other\n  major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of\n  the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates\n  should be stabilized at around current levels.\n      As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to\n  take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States\n  agreed to cut its budget deficit.\n      The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a\n  way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is\n  to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\n      \"If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else\n  you do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent\n  testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\n      Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the\n  government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit\n  supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or\n  to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United\n  States.\n      Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the\n  current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.\n      Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed\n  that any deficit reduction was better than none.\n      But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were \n  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it\n  needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar\n  from plunging further in world exchange markets.\n      \"There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if\n  your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the\n  Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer\n  is, it's not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters.\n      The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's\n  most vexing and persistent problems.\n      The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet\n  little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,\n  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by\n  about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.\n      In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep\n  worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the\n  federal budget.\n      On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not\n  attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for\n  the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced\n  budget law.\n      While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for\n  next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget\n  Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall\n  short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\n      \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the\n  most you're going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,\n  said Touche Ross's Collander. \"To do something more than that\n  would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"\n      Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up\n  short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\n      \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable\n  reduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now\n  look like a failure to Wall Street.\"\n      The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would\n  lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year\n  beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting\n  defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their\n  anticipated spending levels for next year.\n      The Senate Budget Committee has

It was the scale of speculative transactions that\n  determined market trends.\n      Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\n  grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\n  would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\n      \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\n  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\n  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\n  mounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.\n      The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\n  Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\n  going by talking the dollar down posed problems.\n      The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\n  rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\n  of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\n  to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\n  make itself felt compared with the price effect.\n      \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\n  further than would be necessary to adjust the current account\n  over the medium term,\" Koehler said.\n      A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\n  only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\n  In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\n  rise faster than GNP.\n      \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.\n      If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\n  prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\n  an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\n      But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\n  differential would Europe and Japan look for financial\n  investment in the U.S.\n      When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\n  had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\n  measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\n      Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\n  by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\n  interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\n  and its substantial impact on exchange rates.\n      It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\n  price stability, economic growth and full employment but also\n  to tackle international problems like the exchange rate\n  problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\n      A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding\n  of non-inflationary economic growth in an international\n  monetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.\n      Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\n  necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\n  to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\n  the next few years and intervention points should not be set,\n  because they were only testing points for the market, he said.\n      In order to keep the international monetary system free of\n  disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\n  also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.", "AUSTRALIAN UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN MARCH\n  Australia's seasonally adjusted\n  unemployment rate rose to 8.4 pct of the estimated workforce in\n  March from 8.2 pct in February and 7.9 pct a year earlier, the\n  Statistics Bureau said.\n      The number of jobless rose to 650,700 from 631,900 in\n  February and 593,200 a year earlier, the Bureau said.\n      Unadjusted, the number of unemployed rose to 702,600 from\n  699,600 in February but the rate eased to 9.0 pct from 9.1,\n  reflecting a slight increase in the estimated workforce.

Recognized the importance\n  of MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of\n  the influential political group, he added.\n      The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to\n  the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the\n  Postal Savings System, analysts said.\n      MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate\n  interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial\n  liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal\n  Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than\n  banks, they said.\n      Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's\n  obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized\n  the ministry as feudal.\n      Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting\n  competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its\n  wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest\n  price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.\n      But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of\n  its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world\n  including Britain, several analysts said.\n      \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said.\n  \"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order\n  in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable\n  view,\" he said.", "G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING\n  Following is the text of a statement\n  by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,\n  Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting\n  yesterday.\n      1.

The yen sank below 145 at one point\n  despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.\n      Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the\n  movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading\n  ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.\n      \"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past\n  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the\n  discussions in Paris,\" Miyazawa said yesterday.\n      The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was\n  announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of\n  Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's\n  meetings of leading industrial nations.\n      In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action\n  \"extraordinary and urgent\", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris\n  Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges\n  broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.\n      The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West\n  Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore\n  repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to\n  foster exchange rate stability.\n      The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central\n  bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the\n  dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of\n  intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent\n  years. Monetary sources also said they understood that\n  Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely\n  successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.\n      They also said there was a growing feeling among the\n  finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over\n  medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term\n  differences in past meetings.\n      West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like\n  the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of\n  yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other\n  countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.\n      Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that\n  major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance\n  between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's\n  trade deficit have already taken place.\n      No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut\n  the budget deficit even though it is implied in the\n  reafffirmation of Paris.\n      European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are\n  essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that\n  reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.\n      A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this\n  week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further\n  sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly pose\n  substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could\n  undermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said.\n      Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the\n  politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.\n      Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany\n  welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own\n  currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.\n      Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak\n  dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the\n  Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.\n      The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making\n  their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian\n  Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.\n      Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit\n  to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.\n      The United States and France, backed by the International\n  Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for a\n  limited number of economic objectives such as growth,\n  inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current\n  account balances.\n      Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in\n  consultations between the countries on whether corrective\n  action should be required.\n      But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives\n  has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it\n  implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.\n      The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully\n  sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit\n  currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.\n      The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges\n  of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the\n  relatively free currency markets of recent years.", "BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED\n  The Bank of France said it left its\n  intervention rate unchanged at 7-3/4 pct when it injected funds\n  in the market against first category paper in today's money\n  market intervention tender.\n      Money market dealers had earlier expressed mixed views on\n  the possibility of quarter point cut.\n      The rate was last adjusted on March 9, when it was cut to\n  7-3/4 pct from the eight pct rate set in January.", "GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS\n  The global economy is expected to\n  weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious\n  poverty outlook, economic analysts said.\n      For finance ministers and central bankers attending this\n  week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund\n  and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an\n  additional concern.\n      The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct\n  this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.\n      In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a\n  measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to\n  2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.\n      For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,\n  another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0\n  pct from 3.5 pct last year.\n      The new figures are considered a major disappointment to\n  the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the\n  industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil\n  prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope\n  with growing mounds of debt.\n      IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed\n  the industrial country economies would move up to an annual\n  growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.\n      Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some\n  time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into\n  an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.\n      Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier\n  states for markets for their products as well as financial\n  assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' \n  economies poses fundamental worries.\n      Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have\n  only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,\n  including the key one of exports.\n      The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,\n  has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it\n  too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only\n  2.3 pct, according to the IMF.\n      For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the\n  United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to\n  ignite their economies but with little apparent success.\n      The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and\n  the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade\n  deficit.\n      Reagan administration officials have been saying that the\n  impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much\n  slower than expected.\n      The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has\n  to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to\n  work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years\n  to get a resonably complete effect.\"\n      The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even\n  more time on this occasion.\"\n  REUTER^M", "SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES\n  The head of Spain's employers'\n  federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried\n  about the government's monetary policies because high real\n  interest rates were hampering investment.\n      He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this\n  year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation\n  target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by\n  keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.\n      High real interest rates were attracting an influx of\n  speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the\n  government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.\n      Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,\n  liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17\n  pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a\n  target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.\n      To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money\n  rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from\n  11.8 at end-1986.\n      Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to\n  hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,\n  with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new\n  wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.\n      These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish\n  workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.\n      He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the\n  state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five\n  pct wage ceiling.\n      Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in\n  Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first\n  two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct\n  increase over the corresponding period last year.\n      However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the\n  peseta to correct the imbalance.", "SHOWBOAT &lt;SBO> DECLARES STOCK SPLIT\n  Showboat Inc said its board declared a\n  two-for-one stock split, payable to shareholders of record on\n  May 15.", "LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS\n  Lead prices have risen this week against\n  a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders\n  said.\n      Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying\n  or if labour problems develop in North America, they added.\n      London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at\n  a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and\n  prices tending to drift lower.\n      This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low\n  level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical\n  demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.\n      The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be\n  felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,\n  stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders\n  said.\n      The lower supply levels result from a number of different\n  factors around the globe.\n      Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries\n  because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish\n  exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at\n  Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant\n  additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have\n  been drawing on LME stocks.\n      In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,\n  South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks\n  for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet\n  commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.\n      And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes\n  per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks\n  and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the\n  U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and\n  a regular supplier to the world market.\n      Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,\n  have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.\n      On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up\n  quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported\n  in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the\n  first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying\n  order was filled by merchants in March.\n      Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices\n  this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and\n  establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months\n  delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in\n  Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often\n  a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.\n      On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp\n  and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,\n  and this is believed to be in strong hands.\n      Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest\n  level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses\n  which are not popular with merchants putting together\n  shipments.\n      But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since\n  the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to\n  secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies\n  affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on\n  the transport of used batteries.\n      Labour negotiations in North America will play an important\n  part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts\n  expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,\n  Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.\n      Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract\n  expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of\n  strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.\n      Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting\n  speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current\n  firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium\n  to 20 from four.

Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,\n  could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.\n      Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,\n  before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,\n  against losses last year.\n      Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he\n  said.\n      Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buy\n  on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have\n  it,\" he said.\n      The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a\n  share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and\n  from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lot\n  depends on oil prices,\" he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales\n  come from oil and natural gas.\n      Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of\n  Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \"The company's done a lot\n  (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit\n  for,\" she said.\n      She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was\n  trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a\n  share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in\n  1986.\n      Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has\n  been recommending the stocks since last November.\n      Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group\n  although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the\n  third quarter.\n      But he sees potential trouble beyond then. \"I think (steel)\n  prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,\"\n  he said.\n      Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal\n  dropoff later in the year. \"But there are more positives than\n  negatives,\" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic\n  industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should\n  cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.", "DEKALB CORP &lt;DKLBB> 2ND QTR FEB 28 NET\n  Shr 20 cts vs 14 cts\n      Net 2.4 mln vs 1.7 mln\n      Revs 136.7 mln vs 174.4 mln\n      Six Mths\n      SDhr 72 cts vs 82 cts\n      Net 8.6 mln vs 9.9 mln\n      Revs 212.5 mln vs 268.8 mln", "ABBOTT &lt;ABT> SEES GAINS FROM WEAKER DOLLAR\n  Abbott Laboratories Inc said\n  its 1987 first quarter record results reflected continued\n  productivity improvement, higher volume, better product mix and\n  a weaker U.S. dollar.\n      Abbott reported 1987 first quarter earnings rose to a\n  record 142 mln dlrs or 62 cts a share on record sales of one\n  billion dlrs.\n      Research and development expenses, most of which was\n  applied to diagnostic and pharmaceutical products, increased by\n  23 pct to 78 mln dlrs, it said.\n      Sales of pharmaceutical and nutritional products were 548\n  mln dlrs in the first quarter, up 17.6 pct over a year ago,\n  Abbott said.

This\n  year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three\n  weeks later than last year.\n      Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said\n  sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a\n  seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted\n  5.7 pct last year.\n      \"The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate\n  that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear\n  to be because liquidity and employment are rising,\" said\n  analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.\n      Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in\n  according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected\n  to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.\n       In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket\n  items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many\n  analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the\n  holiday nears.\n      \"Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a\n  continuing strength in the housing market,\" said Edward\n  Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an\n  overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's\n  sportswear were also excellent.\n      \"Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even\n  a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment\n  due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,\"\n  said C.J.

Penney's store and\n  catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's\n  overall sales rose 4.8 pct.\n      Penney chairman William Howell said, \"Sales continued\n  strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from\n  very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed\n  southwest.\"\n      \"Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity\n  wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,\n  but are currently hurting sales,\" said Greenstein of Bear\n  Stearns.\n      Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for\n  the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that \"Hudson had a tougher\n  comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986.\"\n      Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower\n  than last year.\n      \"Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are\n  being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales\n  are coming through anyway,\" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.\n      Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  \n  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of\n  the year.\n      Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of\n  May.\n       MARCH RETAIL SALES FOR MAJOR U.S. RETAILERS\n      STORE       PCT        1987       1986\n      SEARS       4.2     2.6 BIL       2.5 BIL \n      K MART      4.6     2.2 BIL       2.1 BIL \n      JC PENNEY  (1.3)    1.1 BIL       1.1 BIL \n      WAL-MART     32     1.1 BIL       855 MLN\n      FEDERATED   4.9     934 MLN       891 MLN\n      MAY         3.5     885 MLN       855 MLN\n      DAYTON      4.8     792 MLN       756 MLN\n      WOOLWORTH   0.2     591 MLN       590 MLN\n      ZAYRE      12.7     522 MLN       464 MLN", "FIRST INTERSTATE EXPECTS BRAZIL, ECUADOR LOAN ACTIONS TO CUT 1987 NET BY 15.4 MLN DLRS", "FIRST INTERSTATE EXPECTS BRAZIL, ECUADOR LOAN ACTIONS TO CUT 1987 NET BY 15.4 MLN DLRS", "MOROCCO TENDERS FOR 55,000 TONNES PL 480 SOYOIL\n  Morocco is scheduled to tender April 14\n  for a total of 55,000 tonnes of U.S. soyoil under PL-480 for\n  shipments from May through September, private export sources\n  said.\n      The tender calls for shipment of 6,100 tonnes in May,\n  12,200 tonnes each in June, July and August and 12,300 tonnes\n  in September, they said.", "MIDLANTIC CORP &lt;MIDL> 1ST QTR NET\n  Shr diluted 1.18 dlrs vs 1.04 dlrs\n      Net 45.0 mln vs 39.2 mln\n      Assets 16.7 billion vs 15.2 billion\n      Deposits 13.0 billion vs 12.1 billion\n      Loans 11.9 billion vs 10.1 billion\n      NOTE: Results restated for merger of Midlantic Banks Inc\n  and Continental Bancorp Inc on January 30, 1987.", "COMMUNITY BANK SYSTEM INC &lt;CBSI> 1ST QTR NET\n  Shr 46 cts vs 49 cts\n      Net 1,101,551 vs 831,398\n      NOTE: Share adjusted for two-for-one stock split in May\n  1986.", "FITCHBURG GAS &lt;FGE> RAISES QUARTERLY\n  Qtly div 38 cts vs 35 cts prior\n      Pay May 15\n      Record May One", "NORTHERN TRUST &lt;NTRS> NET HURT BY BRAZIL LOANS\n  Northern Trust Corp said its first\n  quarter earnings were reduced by 875,000 dlrs by placing 53.2\n  mln dlrs of loans to Brazil and six mln dlrs in loans to\n  Ecuador on a cash basis.\n      Should these loans remain on nonperforming basis for the\n  rest of 1987, net income for year will be cut by about 3.2 mln\n  dlrs, the bank said.\n      Earlier it posted net income for the period of 14.7 mln\n  dlrs or 87 cts a share, up from 11.7 mln dlrs or 73 cts a\n  share.\n      Total nonperforming assets were 114.1 mln dlrs at March 31,\n  up from 53.4 mln dlrs at December 31 and 79 mln dlrs at March\n  31, 1986 the bank said.\n      The provision for loan losses for the first quarter was\n  eight mln dlrs compared to 11 mln a year ago.

The\n  stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.\n      He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage\n  the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.\n      These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget\n  and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.\n      The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile\n  management was counter-productive, he said.", "USDA ESTIMATES EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CROPS\n  The U.S. Agriculture Department\n  forecast the European Community's 1986/87 wheat crop at 71.60\n  mln tonnes, vs 71.50 mln tonnes last month.

been as effective as\n  had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances\n  from emerging in the global economy.\n      In remarks before the afternoon session of the\n  International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he\n  was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.\n      \"But I do suggest,\" he said, \"that we need something to give\n  it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction\n  when the wind shifts.\"\n      He said that indicators can serve \"as a kind of compass\" but\n  added that structural indicators can help focus attention on\n  some policies.\n      Baker, however, said the IMF \"needs to move beyond\n  macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that\n  can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific\n  relevance to the imbalances we face today.\"\n      The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given\n  a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article\n  IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.\n      Baker also told the policy making group that it was time\n  for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF\n  surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the\n  public.\n      \"In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF\n  appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of\n  follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF\n  recommendations, and greater use of special consultation\n  procedures,\" he said.\n      Baker emphasized that indicators were a device \"for moving\n  beyond rhetoric to action.\"\n      He said they provide \"more structure to the system, and\n  induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of\n  policy coordination.\"\n      He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be\n  reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.\n      \"This should be matter of priority for the executive board,\"\n  he said.\n      Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative\n  medium-term economic scenarios for countries that \"can help us\n  focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by\n  identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the\n  implications of these options.\"\n      He said also that further work should be done on finding\n  paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.\n

Commodities from gold to grains to\n  cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses\n  in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of\n  inflation and economic

troy ounce.\n      A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that\n  inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations\n  to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve\n  Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,\n  Harris Upham and Co., in New York.\n      The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from\n  the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their\n  commitment to support its value, and despite reports of\n  intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.\n      Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known\n  as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term\n  direction of the currency markets.\n      \"Maybe they have some ideas or plans,\" said Chronowitz. \"If\n  they do, it's not evident.\"\n      \"It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market\n  take values to where they should be.\n      \"One way or another, we will force our major

time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's\n  going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's\n  happening,\" he said.\n      The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities\n  cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.\n      At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds\n  saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning\n  to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty\n  McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of\n  Dominick and Dominick.\n      The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout\n  the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton\n  posted broad gains.\n      Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the\n  grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome\n  supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate\n  export demand.\n      After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department\n  raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by\n  two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.\n      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the\n  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately\n  higher.\n      Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices.

It added\n  temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of\n  customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves\n  directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n      Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the\n  two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on\n  Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs.

Interest rates fell\n  sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.\n      But that confidence is now cracking as the financial\n  markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's\n  often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\n      \"Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar\n  freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,\" said\n  David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\n      The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\n  40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\n  failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\n  credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\n  of further depreciation of the dollar.\n      Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\n  worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare\n  away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\n      The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\n  dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\n  in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\n  by 33 points to 2339.\n      Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\n  markets' instability frightening. He believes economic\n  fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once\n  you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.\"\n      \"There's a stark possibility that you could get a\n  destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\n  and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"\n      Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\n  in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\n  controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\n  264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\n      \"We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\n  the agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.\n      Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\n  year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\n  would take very little to touch off what he calls the second\n  phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\n  dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\n      The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on\n  March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\n      The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\n  historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\n  not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\n  decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\n      Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest\n  weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\n  suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\n  below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\n  part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\n      Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\n  confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\n  plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\n  imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\n      Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\n  return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\n  addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\n  massive budget deficit.\n      But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\n  central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\n  choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\n      \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\n  substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\n  cut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston's Jones.\n      Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\n  rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\n  American farmers, Latin American governments and others.\n      But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\n  Co, scoffed at the notion. \"It's ridiculous to think the Federal\n  Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\n  against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\n  weakness,\" he said.\n      Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\n  made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\n      \"We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\n  budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\n  cares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\n  will have been greater.\n      He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\n  thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\n      But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\n  a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on\n  your helmets,\" Giordano said.", "AVERAGE YEN CD RATES FALL IN LATEST WEEK\n  Average interest rates on yen\n  certificates of deposit (CD) fell to 4.13 pct in the week ended\n  April 8 from 4.33 pct the previous week, the Bank of Japan\n  said.\n      New rates (previous in brackets) -\n      Average CD rates all banks 4.13 pct (4.33)\n      Money Market Certificate (MMC) ceiling rates for week\n  starting from April 13 -       3.38 pct (3.58)\n      Average CD rates of city, trust and long-term banks -\n      Less than 60 days          4.15 pct (4.41)\n      60-90 days                 4.14 pct (4.29)\n      Average CD rates of city, trust and long-term banks -\n      90-120 days                4.12 pct (4.25)\n      120-150 days               4.12 pct (4.23)\n      150-180 days               unquoted (4.03)\n      180-270 days               4.05 pct (4.05)\n      Over 270 days              4.05 pct (unqtd)\n      Average yen bankers acceptance rates of city, trust and\n  long-term banks -\n      30 to less than 60 days    3.98 pct (4.20)\n      60-90 days                 4.03 pct (3.97)\n      90-120 days                unquoted (unqtd)", "JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE\n  Bank of Japan sources said the bank\n  has no plans to cut its discount rate.\n      They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan\n  during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower\n  its discount rate.

Payments on remaining debt would be linked to\n  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.\n      \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that\n  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that\n  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\"\n  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in\n  Calgary.\n      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome\n  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed\n  refinancing packages, Gobert said.\n      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome\n  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders\n  to agree to a restructuring, he added.\n      \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain\n  any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said.\n      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that\n  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix\n  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other\n  possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to\n  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little\n  reluctant to come forward,\" he said.\n      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal\n  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a\n  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.\n      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions\n  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other\n  unidentified parties.

out of patience with Japan which\n  they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open\n  its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.\n      Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC\n  countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the\n  willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese\n  government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.\n      However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as\n  EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.\n      Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to\n  an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could\n  raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.\n  Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.\n      The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations\n  entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed\n  to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of\n  the U.S.\n      The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's\n  trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in\n  March, up from 1.94 billion in February.\n      In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion\n  dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one\n  pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.\n      In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has\n  decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.\n      Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen\n  Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application\n  of French quality standards -- something EC states say often\n  happens to their own exports entering Japan.\n      Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese\n  banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,\n  because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in\n  competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.\n      However, British officials in London have said that the\n  government may have gone too far in implying that it would take\n  immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.\n      By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful\n  economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring\n  to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own\n  industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.\n      The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent\n  years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open\n  its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.\n      At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end\n  allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and\n  spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts\n  for the building of a new international airport, and to\n  simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.\n      EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but\n  often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff\n  barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.\n      They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the\n  EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.\n      One of the problems Britain could face if it were to\n  withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers\n  would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,\n  they point out.", "MORGAN CRUCIBLE SAYS PROSPECTS ARE ENCOURAGING\n  Morgan Crucible Co Plc &lt;MGCR.L> said the\n  prospects for 1987 were encouraging, with orders and

The five institutes had jointly forecast\n  three pct 1987 growth in October last year.\n      Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin\n  and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.\n      The joint report said that the estimates of economic\n  development made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less\n  favourable\" than those of the other three.\n      The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a\n  slow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will,\n  however, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said.\n      The two institutes said external economic factors which\n  were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would\n  dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw\n  exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no\n  marked improvement in the course of the year.\n      The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in\n  demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not\n  indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\"\n      They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate\n  uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.\n  But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled\n  but only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions\n  (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\"\n      They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation\n  of the economic uptrend are still favourable.\"\n      These three institutes said diminishing external burdens\n  combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in\n  demand and production could be expected by the spring.\n      However, this projection was clouded by risks including the\n  further development of the mark against the dollar.\n      Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that\n  while exports would continue to be the weak point of the\n  economy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports\n  will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during\n  the course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall\n  in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.\n      The three more positive institutes saw private consumption\n  rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,\n  while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.\n      They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but\n  predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in\n  1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.\n      All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in\n  unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the\n  jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23\n  mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in\n  work of about 200,000.\n      These three institutes said new jobs would be created\n  mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in\n  the context of job creation measures. The construction industry\n  was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980\n  but they predicted either no rise in employment in the\n  manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.\n      The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only\n  in the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the\n  manufacturing industry will decline.\"\n      The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to\n  2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.\n      They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58\n  billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a\n  current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks\n  and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around\n  100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.\n      The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to\n  rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five\n  predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.", "BLUE ARROW TO BUY U.S. RICHARDS COMPANIES\n  &lt;Blue Arrow Plc> said it had agreed\n  terms to acquire a group of U.S. Companies collectively known\n  as the &lt;Richards Companies>, which specialise in executive\n  recruitment and management consultancy on personnel matters.\n      The total consideration will be 29 mln U.S. Dlrs of which\n  50 pct will be payable in cash and 50 pct by the issue of 1.36\n  mln new ordinary shares in Blue Arrow.\n      The Richard Companies made a pre-tax profit of 3.6 mln dlrs\n  in the year to end-1986, on turnover of 7.1 mln dlrs with net\n  tangible assets at the end of 1986 of 3.4 mln dlrs.\n      Blue Arrow shares were trading 9p lower at 670 this\n  morning.", "SAUDI RIYAL DEPOSITS SURGE ON U.S. RATE RISE\n  Saudi riyal interbank deposit rates\n  surged across the board as banks tried to build long positions\n  in anticipation of a further rise in U.S. Interest rates,\n  dealers said.\n      They said traders expected riyal deposits to follow the\n  recent strong rise in eurodollar rates sparked by fears of a\n  tighter U.S. Monetary policy to halt the dollar's slide.\n      \"There was a wave of panic buying early in the morning as\n  people tried to cover gaps and build long riyal positions,\" said\n  one dealer.

Gross national\n  product grew 2.4 pct last year.\n      But the report said all the institutes believed that \"more\n  must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional\n  jobs can be created.\"\n      The institutes said any step which improved basic economic\n  conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. \"From this\n  point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be\n  brought forward.\"\n      The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion\n  marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from\n  the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.\n      However, the institutes criticised the government, not only\n  for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of\n  its financing had been left open.\n      The government has not specified how the remaining 19\n  billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,\n  though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.\n      The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had\n  caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what\n  exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a\n  quick decision from the government.\n      They also said the government should reduce tax\n  preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a\n  restriction of state spending and called for no increase in\n  value-added tax.\n      The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing\n  subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.\n      They referred specifically to a doubling of special\n  writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a\n  package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this\n  as an increase in subsidies.\n      The institutes said total subsidies, including tax\n  preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen\n  further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it\n  should be possible \"despite ... Major political difficulties\" to\n  finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.\n      The institutes said that if the government raised value\n  added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the\n  positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.\n      The report also noted that the government was progressing\n  only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and\n  said more deregulation was needed.

That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.\n      Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told\n  television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving\n  the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.\n      \"It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would\n  adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would\n  drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not\n  (into) recession, into slower growth,\" he said.\n      Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the\n  dollar, Balladur said: \"When a currency is maintained\n  artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is\n  not healthy.\"\n      And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to\n  recession, he said.\n      Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of\n  life, Balladur said, \"there may be adjustments of course in one\n  or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.\"\n      But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he\n  might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.\n      U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it\n  understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.\n      \"The United States and the six major industrial countries\n  are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these\n  agreements,\" Baker told the meetings.\n      Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which\n  wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further\n  decline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to\n  stabilizing currencies at current levels.\n      Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February\n  22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed\n  to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight\n  protectionism.\n      West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate\n  domestic demand and lead a global upturn.\n      Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's\n  promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.\n      The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major\n  action. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable\n  currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at\n  the time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.\n      The Paris accord said, \"currencies (are) within ranges\n  broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given\n  the policy commitments summarized in this statement.\"\n      Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially\n  against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent\n  with the agreement. \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the\n  view that around current levels their currencies are within\n  ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,\" last week's\n  statement read.\n      Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were\n  focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.\n  Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan\n  rather than prospective policy changes.

That spread has narrowed again.\n      \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\"\n  said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.\n      Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is\n  justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and\n  the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a\n  percentage point.\n      He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage\n  points since last October until it fell below one point and\n  triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.\n      \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon\n  as this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.\n      \"We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the\n  near future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n      \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding\n  costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\"\n  said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.\n      However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime\n  because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan\n  demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain\n  recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.\n      Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift\n  short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He\n  said \"if there is widespread belief money market rates will\n  stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\"\n      Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a\n  dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar\n  fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders\n  said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.\n      In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to\n  stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.\n  interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.\n      Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions\n  on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has become\n  clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure\n  in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\"\n      Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest\n  rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation\n  that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.\n      That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the\n  market than most economists had expected.\n      On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small\n  amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements\n  with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another\n  high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct\n  today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr\n  round of customer repurchase agreements.\n      \"The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is\n  offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"\n  said Jones of Lanston.\n      \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the\n  need to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is\n  merely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a\n  major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy\n  overtly at some point.\"\n      Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by\n  becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within\n  four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.\n      Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might\n  well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to\n  further aid the dollar.\n      Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on\n  30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate\n  may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.\n      \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening\n  policy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He\n  said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.\n  Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures\n  abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.", "HEALTH AND REHABILITATION &lt;HRP> SETS FIRST DIVI\n  Health and Rehabilitation\n  Properties Trust said it declared its initial dividend of 55\n  cts per share for the quarter ending March 31, 1987.\n      The dividend is payable May 20 to shareholders of record\n  April 20, 1987, it said.\n      The dividend includes five cts attributable to the period\n  between Dec 23 and 31, 1986, and 50 cts attributable to the\n  first quarter of 1987, ending March 31, 1987.", "UTAH POWER AND LIGHT CO &lt;UTP> 1ST QTR NET\n  Shr 46 cts vs 58 cts\n      Net 29.0 mln vs 37.9 mln\n      Revs 251.2 mln vs 254.2 mln\n      Avg shrs 57.9 mln vs 56.0 mln\n      12 mths\n      Shr 1.36 dlrs vs 2.37 dlrs\n      Net 93.7 mln vs 152.3 mln\n      Revs 981.9 mln vs 1.03 billion\n      Avg shrs 57.2 mln vs 55.3 mln\n      NOTE: 1987 12 mth net includes 43.7 mln dlr charge due to\n  December 1986 provision for coal mining operations refund.", "ERICSSON &lt;ERICY.O> TO BUY REST OF SPANISH UNIT\n  L.M.

the some\n  20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa\n  Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.\n      In his March annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to\n  full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide\n  American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.\"\n      He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the\n  pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world\n  markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.\n      U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March\n  announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.\n      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  \"we\n  do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of\n  action that requires meaningful action.\"\n      Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,\n  with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.\n      About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.\n      Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to\n  retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.\n      He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent\n  negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that\n  existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.\n      Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was\n  as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not\n  need any new trade legislation.\n      The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring\n  the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the\n  results showed up.\n      U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of\n  Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and\n  Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the\n  Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.\n      Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would\n  file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade\n  (GATT).\n      It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had\n  violated the regulations of the global trading group and would\n  approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.\n      U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would\n  retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with\n  the United States.", "UNION PLANTERS CORP &lt;UPCM.O>

The\n  tariffs were placed on items which were available from other\n  sources so there would be little effect on the American\n  consumer, Fitzwater said.\n      Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action\n  - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade\n  practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.\n      The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.\n      The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion\n  dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about\n  one-third of America's overall deficit.\n      But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West\n  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the\n  president is ready to fight them all.\n      Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regret\n  that these actions are necessary,\" but that the health and\n  vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to\n  American competitiveness in world markets.\n      \"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading\n  practices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his California\n  vacation home at Santa Barbara.\n      He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan\n  abided by the agreement.\n      U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -\n  which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he\n  already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.\n      The White House aide said of the tariff action, \"it wasn't\n  done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade\n  practice.\"\n      The aide added, however, \"on another plane, it was an\n  example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight\n  unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major\n  overall of our trade laws.\"\n      But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not\n  in the best interests of the United States, and that\n  negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.\n      \"It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,\" he\n  said, \"because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in\n  trade.\"\n      Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its\n  political impact across the country, and therefore its impact\n  on Congress.\"\n      He said, \"I don't think it makes a lot of sense.\"\n      But other analysts said it made little difference whether\n  the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,\n  and that the main point was that the trading partners were on\n  notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.\n      Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don't want a trade war,\" but the\n  imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when\n  it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.\n      Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its\n  political impact across the country, and therefore its impact\n  on Congress.\"\n      He said, \"I don't think it makes a

DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY\n  U.S. banking data released today are\n  too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary\n  policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the\n  Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,\n  economists said.\n      \"It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount\n  window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate\n  average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent\n  with a modest tightening,\" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago\n  Corp.\n      Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that\n  the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.\n      Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were\n  935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week\n  statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of\n  December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.\n      Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion\n  dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this\n  year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the\n  Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in\n  reserves than the Fed had anticipated.\n      However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed\n  is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than\n  witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have\n  forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.\n      First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week\n  ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,\n  partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the\n  proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to\n  pay annual income taxes.\n      As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the\n  reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.\n      Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion\n  dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists\n  said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the\n  projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to\n  add reserves too late.\n      Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently\n  left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which\n  to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists\n  said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos\n  outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add\n  even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.\n      \"It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as\n  much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,\"\n  said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.\n      McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting\n  discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,\n  equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.\n      After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not\n  tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,\n  economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging \n  overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the\n  statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.\n      Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that\n  the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's\n  figures, he said, \"It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving\n  toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.\"\n      Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8\n  pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate\n  unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.\n      Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political\n  opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time\n  when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to\n  reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.", "RORER GROUP INC &lt;ROR> 1ST QTR NET\n  Oper shr profit 34 cts vs loss 78 cts\n      Oper net profit 7,434,000 vs loss 17.0 mln\n      Revs 201.2 mln vs 171.7 mln\n      Note: Year-ago oper exludes gain on sale of businesses of\n  139.6 mln.\n      Year-ago oper includes charges of 27.8 mln resulting from\n  allocation of the purchase price of Revlon's businesses to\n  inventory and 7.1 mln for restructuring costs.", "MILD COFFEE GROWERS TO MEET IN GUATEMALA\n  A large group of \"other milds\"\n  coffee-growing nations will hold talks in Guatemala next month\n  to map their strategy for next September's meeting of the\n  International Coffee Organisation (ICO).\n      Mario Fernandez, executive director of the Costa Rican\n  coffee institute, said delegates from Mexico, the Dominican\n  Republic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and five\n  central american nations will participate in the two-day\n  strategy session beginning May 4.\n      The main topic will be reform of what many producing\n  countries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of export\n  quotas, Fernandez said.\n      He said Costa Rica would press for quotas \"based on the\n  real production and export potential of each country in the\n  past few years\" and to distribute quotas based on \"historic\"\n  production levels rather than recent harvests and crop\n  estimates.", "US STUDY DISCUSSES DROPPED COMSAT-CONTEL MERGER\n  A congressional study today said the\n  proposed, but now apparently abandoned, merger of the\n  Communications Satellite Corp &lt;CQ> and Contel Corp &lt;CTC>\n  would technically be legal but could violate the spirt of the\n  law setting up COMSAT.\n      Two weeks ago before the study was completed, Contel\n  announced it would seek to terminate the proposed merger.\n      The study by the non partisan Congressional Research\n  Service (CRS) said \"the proposed merger appears to comply,\n  technically, with the mandates or letter of statutes, if may\n  nevertheless violate the spirit of the law.\"\n      Comsat, created by a 1962 act of Congress, and Contel, a\n  corporation of local telephone and communications firms, filed\n  with the Federal Communications Commission last November 3 an\n  application for merger.

But\n  there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change\n  sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.\n      Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning\n  that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained\n  dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.\n      He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per\n  million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to\n  apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra\n  cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.\n      Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it\n  is not properly dried or ground.\n      Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in\n  London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC\n  standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,\n  but this was likely to take several years of research.\n      Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total\n  coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.\n      Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's\n  department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of\n  avoiding the copra process altogether.\n      \"There are ways of producing coconut products outside of\n  copra,\" Romero said. \"We can process fresh coconut without drying\n  the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process\n  coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to\n  the chemical root.\"\n      He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to\n  become more protectionist and he expected export prices of\n  coconut products to drop.\n      \"In the long term we will be getting less and less for more\n  and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,\" he\n  said.\n      With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up\n  production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil\n  output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.\n      \"To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending\n  billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by\n  saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,\"\n  he said.\n      Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to\n  stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a\n  high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,\n  and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.\n      Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year\n  coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall\n  after two successive years of good harvests.\n      He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to\n  add to the production fall, drought had affected output.\n      \"Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the\n  prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep\n  prices stable is by processing, adding more value,\" he said.\n      Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by\n  planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.\n      \"A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on\n  10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,\" Romero\n  said. He said the government's proposed land reform program\n  would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they\n  had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.\n      \"If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,\n  production and employment then it won't happen,\" he said.\n      PCA figures show about one-third of the country's\n  population is dependent on the coconut industry.\n      Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or\n  one-fourth of total agricultural land.", "PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE\n  Crude oil prices could remain around 18\n  dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on\n  output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an\n  official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos\n  (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.\n      Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of\n  international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared\n  to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself\n  for the third quarter. \"Production is surging ahead of what was\n  originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than\n  envisaged a few months ago,\" he said.\n      He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of\n  production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the\n  18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been\n  envisaged might soften price levels.\n      The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in\n  Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.\n      \"I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in\n  terms of volume decisions,\" Lajous said.\n      A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted\n  output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is\n  always there as a possibility, he said.\n      \"I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I\n  expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and\n  discipline will be maintained,\" he said.\n      Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as\n  this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil\n  markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during\n  1987 if output remains under control.\n      He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that\n  increased production was not so important as long as incomes\n  would not be affected by the output, were \"very relevant and\n  welcome from such a powerful producer.\"", "CONISTON GROUP TO CONTINUE BID FOR ALLEGIS &lt;AEG>\n  An investor group led by Coniston\n  Partners said it plans to continue its effort to gain control\n  of Allegis Corp despite the defensive maneuvers Allegis\n  announced last week.\n      Allegis said then that it would borrow three billion dlrs\n  and pay shareholders a dividend of 60 dlrs per share, lowering\n  the company's net worth.

However, he\n  said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation\n  expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates\n  in the longer term.\n      In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,\n  or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts\n  point to a falling rate of economic growth.\n      \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement\n  negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\"\n  the ABN economist said.\n      He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in\n  January, could also contribute to some inflation.\n      At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to\n  two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,\n  currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the\n  second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.\n      Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying\n  spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,\n  probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below\n  five pct.\n      Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in\n  the money market.", "NORTHGATE QUEBEC GOLD WORKERS END STRIKE\n  Northgate Exploration Ltd said\n  hourly-paid workers at its two Chibougamau, Quebec mines voted\n  on the weekend to accept a new three-year contract offer and\n  returned to work today after a one-month strike.\n      It said the workers, represented by United Steelworkers of\n  America, would receive a 1.21 dlr an hour pay raise over the\n  life of the new contract and improved benefits.\n      Northgate, which produced 23,400 ounces of gold in first\n  quarter, said that while the strike slowed production, \"We are\n  still looking forward to a very satisfactory performance.\"\n      The Chibougamau mines produced 81,500 ounces of gold last\n  year.", "ROYAL GOLD &lt;RGLD.O> AGREES TO MAKE ACQUISITION\n  Royal Gold Inc said it has signed two\n  agreements in principle to acquire the stock of two\n  &lt;Transwestern Mining Co> units for 1.1 mln shares of Royal Gold\n  common stock.\n      Royal said the assets of the units it will acquire from\n  Transwestern are mostly gold properties.\n      It added it expects to close the deals on June 18 and 19,\n  subject to standard closing conditions, including title and\n  environmental approval and closing of a definitive agreement.\n      Royal said the shares issued in the deal will be subject to\n  registration rights.", "HAWKINS CHEMICAL INC&lt;HWKN.O> 2ND QTR MAR 31 NET\n  Shr 12 cts vs six cts\n      Net 398,318 vs 211,801\n      Sales 7,385,107 vs 7,275,162\n      Six Mths\n      Shr 22 cts vs 13 cts\n      Net 736,219 vs 446,288\n      Sales 14.3 mln vs 14.2 mln\n      NOTE: Per share earnings adjusted for ten pct stock\n  dividend paid February 1987.", "NORTHGATE &lt;NGX> QUEBEC WORKERS END STRIKE\n  Northgate Exploration Ltd said\n  hourly-paid workers at its two Chibougamau, Quebec, mines voted\n  on the weekend to accept a three-year contract offer and\n  returned to work today after a one-month strike.\n      It said the workers, represented by United Steelworkers of\n  America, would receive a 1.21-dlr-an-hour pay raise over the\n  life of the new contract and improved benefits.\n      Northgate, which produced 23,400 ounces of gold in first\n  quarter, said that while the strike slowed production, \"We are\n  still looking forward to a very satisfactory performance.\" The\n  Chibougamau mines produced 81,500 ounces of gold last year.", "PORTUGUESE UNEMPLOYMENT STEADY IN FIRST QUARTER\n  Unemployment in Portugal held steady at\n  9.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987 after the same rate in the\n  last quarter of 1986, the National Statistics Institute said.\n      This compared with 11.1 pct unemployment in the first\n  quarter of 1986.\n      The total number of registered unemployed in the first\n  quarter of this year was 437,500.", "PARTNERSHIP UPS HBO &lt;HBOC.O> STAKE TO 8.7 PCT\n  Andover Group, a Great Falls, Va.,\n  investment partnership that is seeking control of HBO and Co,\n  said it raised its stake in the company to 2,026,000 shares, or\n  8.7 pct of the total, from 1,626,000 shares, or 7.0 pct.\n      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\n  the partnership said it bought 400,000 HBO common shares for\n  5.4 mln dlrs on May 28.\n      The group, which has a slate of candidates seeking board\n  seats, said it would decide whether to submit an offer to\n  acquire the company after the HBO annual shareholders meeting,\n  which was to have been April 30, but was postponed.", "HUMANA &lt;HUM> TO BUY INT'L MEDICAL ASSETS\n  Humana Inc said a Florida Judge\n  approved a previously announced proposal for the company to buy\n  certain assets of International Medical Centers, which had been\n  declared insolvent and put into receivership in early May.\n      Humana said it will pay 40 mln dlrs to the state's\n  Department of Insurance to pay prior claims and 20 mln dlrs in\n  working capital.", "DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIES (DMC) TO SELL UNITS\n  Diversified Industries Inc plans to\n  recover more than four mln dlrs from the sale of two marginal\n  subsidiaries, chairman Ben Fixman told the annual meeting.\n      Fixman said Diversified Industries, as part of its effort\n  to redeploy assets, wants to sell its Theodore Sall Inc and\n  Liberty Smelting Works (1962) Ltd units.

Wang\n  took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought\n  15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3\n  mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.\n      Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer\n  businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe\n  computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.\n      Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the\n  merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.\n      On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six\n  companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.\n      For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on\n  sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.\n      The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely\n  because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,\n  Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the\n  dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or\n  56 cts a share.\n     At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different\n  businesses, only three of which were involved in computer\n  software.

He said\n  about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.\n      Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of\n  current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But\n  they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute\n  Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.\n      Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of\n  completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,\n  he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05\n  dlrs a share.\n      Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations\n  of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing\n  and research and development.\n      Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.\n  Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50\n  dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly\n  33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.\n      Stephen T.

Analysts were predicting\n  prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.\n      However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing\n  in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to\n  4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.\n      The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very\n  little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.\n      There was also a lack of significant demand from major\n  steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.\n      Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin\n  holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,\n  and the bulk of material still available is being held by\n  Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the\n  market with unwanted metal.\n      Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the\n  International Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted\n  support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members\n  nations of the International Tin Agreement.\n      The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker\n  Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported\n  having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin\n  position.\n      Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin\n  prices and movements are still expected to be largely related\n  to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand\n  emerges for the third quarter.\n      The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made\n  efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world\n  prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an\n  export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two\n  major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and\n  apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to\n  consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.", "CO-OPERATIVE &lt;COBK.O> COMPLETES ACQUISITION\n  Co-operative Bancorp said it\n  completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding\n  stock of the Quincy Co-operative Bank &lt;QBCK.O>.\n      Under the agreement, Quincy stockholders will receive 30\n  dlrs cash for each share owned of the Quincy Co-operative Bank,\n  for a total transaction of approximately 50 mln dlrs,\n  Co-operative said.", "MONSANTO &lt;MTC> TO ACQUIRE RHONE-POULENC ASSETS\n  Monsanto Co said it is acquiring\n  certain commerical assets of &lt;Rhone-Poulenc Chimie's>\n  polyphenyl business.\n      Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n      Among the assets being acquired are its polyphenyl business\n  worldwide, including biphenyl and the heat transfer fluid\n  Gilotherm TH, together with associated manufacturing and\n  application technology, Monsanto said.", "INFO-DATA TO ACQUIRE USA OUTDOOR ADVERTISING\n  &lt;Info-Data Inc> said it\n  will acquire &lt;USA Outdoor Advertising Inc> of Jacksonville,\n  Fla., in exchange for stock.\n      USA Outdoor Advertising was acquired for 62.4 pct of the\n  outstanding shares of Info-Data Inc, the company said.\n      Info-Data said it plans to change its name to USA Outdoor\n  Advertising Inc to reflect the change in the company's\n  operations.", "REAGAN URGES FULFILLMENT OF EXCHANGE ACCORDS\n  President Reagan, preparing to depart\n  for the Venice economic summit on Wednesday, said the United\n  States and its allies must fulfill agreements on exchange rate\n  stability.\n      \"Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo, and at\n  this year's meetings of Group of 7 Finance ministers in Paris\n  and in Washington, cannot be ignored or forgotten,\" he said.\n      \"The commitments made at these meetings need to be\n  translated into action,\" Reagan said in a pre-summit speech\n  celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan.", "UNI-MARTS &lt;IMMA.O> ACQUIRES GAS-N-ALL STORES\n  Uni Marts Inc said it acquired\n  seven &lt;Gas-N-All Inc> convenience stores for an undisclosed\n  amount of cash.\n      The acquisition bring to 228 the number of convenience\n  stores owned by Uni-Marts, the company said.", "REAGAN HINTS U.S. WANTS HELP IN PATROLLING GULF\n  President Reagan said he would discuss\n  the Mideast Gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's\n  Venice economic summit and hinted he would seek their help in\n  preserving free navigation.\n      In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made\n  plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack,\n  Reagan said the American people were aware that \"it is not our\n  interests alone that are being protected.\"\n      Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret,\n  Reagan declared, \"During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will\n  be discussing the common security interests shared by the\n  western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf.\n      \"The future belongs to the brave.

When he left Burlington in November,\n  1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to\n  divulge inside information about the company.\n      Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began\n  working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to\n  \"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its\n  management,\" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.\n      Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from\n  PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information\n  and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or\n  Burlington's public financial statements.\n      Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with\n  Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with\n  them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went\n  public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.\n  Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a\n  takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in\n  February.\n      Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held\n  discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as\n  financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off\n  because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and\n  dominion with a written statement that they did not provide\n  inside information.\n      Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen\n  withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman\n  Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and\n  threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an\n  effort to takeover Burlilgnton.\n      \"The ultimate question is not the price per share or the\n  profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for\n  those who would takeover an American company,\" said burlington\n  lawyer Humphrey.\n      Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the\n  largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in\n  violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's\n  largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants\n  in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,\n  the lawyers said.\n      Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the\n  market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends\n  and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light\n  weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price\n  dictate.\n      Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by\n  Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid\n  for Dominion. \"Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose\n  would have been sauce for the gander,\" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,\n  a Samjens lawyer.", "EDELMAN DETAILS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> OPTIONS SALE\n  A tender offer of Asher Edelman and\n  Dominion Textile Ltd &lt;DTX.TO> for Burlington Idustries Inc is\n  not affected by the investors' sale of options to buy\n  Burlington stock, according to an associate of Edelman.\n      Noting that \"our tender offer is definitely in place\" the\n  aide said the investors are prohibited by Securities and\n  Exchange Commission regulations from exercising options as long\n  as a tender offer is open.

Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange\n  operations with brokers based outside the country, according to\n  a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.\n      The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has\n  effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's\n  volatile currency market.\n      The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez\n  Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international\n  operations.\n      The telex said the restriction on business with foreign\n  brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign\n  exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign\n  currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.\n      In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied\n  rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to\n  prop up the weakening bolivar.\n      But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de\n  facto currency control. \"It is definitely a control in the sense\n  that there's no longer complete freedom to operate,\" one broker\n  here said.\n      \"Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction\n  is towards complete control,\" the broker said.\n      The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his\n  Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since\n  the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with\n  telephone calls.\n      He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume\n  of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs\n  a day. \"It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,\" he\n  said.\n      The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the\n  prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary\n  between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.\n      \"We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's\n  ridiculous,\" he said. \"They've been on a rampage against\n  foreigners.\"\n      The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central\n  bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange\n  business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct\n  reserve requirement.\n      In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in\n  bolivar futures, the broker said.\n      \"We used to have a forward market,\" he said. \"For a small\n  currency it was miraculous.\"\n      He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.\n  Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range\n  of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly

Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.\n      He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole\n  would probably be between one and two pct.\n     \"It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic\n  demand does not grow strongly,\" he said, noting that interest\n  rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.\n      Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money\n  stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace\n  of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six\n  pct target.\n      He said the target could still be achieved but much will\n  depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy\n  inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS\n  revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.\n      \"There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of\n  foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit\n  reversed,\" Schlesinger said.\n      A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction\n  that the mark was headed higher. \"As we can see from the market,\n  expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have\n  diminished,\" Schlesinger said.\n      The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the\n  fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period\n  and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined\n  towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.\n      Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar\n  rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87\n  marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.\n      At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.\n      \"Central banks are always in contact about these\n  fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,\"\n  Schelsinger said.\n      \"One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,\" he said,\n  adding, \"It is not only our own case, it is also the American\n  case.\"\n      He said that the West German export industry has been hit\n  hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see\n  some correction now. \"But it wouldn't be good to have short-term\n  fluctuations,\" he said. \"Let us wait and see.\"\n      \"It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very\n  short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level\n  (of rates) as such,\" Schlesinger said.\n      The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of\n  such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West\n  German inflation down year.\n      Although there have recently been signs of inflation\n  picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key\n  commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would\n  be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.\n      Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth\n  was longer term, in that the economy was building up the\n  potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.\n      The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16\n  months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of\n  targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the\n  mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.\n      But he added: \"I don't see any great pressure to go away\n  from it.\"", "JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS\n  Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could\n  mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into\n  bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.\n      They said the relaxation of controls was now under review\n  by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of\n  International Trade and Industry (MITI).\n      A spokesman for a major firm said, \"Deregulation would bring\n  about a reorganization.

Last year's GNP\n  growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.\n      \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources\n  and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that\n  domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and\n  would not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said.\n      \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at\n  key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,\n  showed that the economy was on a different track from last\n  year,\" he said.\n      Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the\n  first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it\n  could drop off in the third quarter.\n      He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the\n  manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in\n  1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.\n      \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said.\n      He said the government had met all monetary targets set for\n  the first quarter in consultation with the International\n  Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth\n  tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.\n      The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling\n  58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.\n  Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or\n  August to review performance in the January-June period.\n      He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion\n  dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.\n  Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their\n  net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.\n      \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA\n  (official development assistance) accounts the commercial\n  banking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said.\n      It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF\n  debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.\n      The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28\n  billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.\n      Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984\n  to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in\n  April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in\n  October last year, had almost been completed.\n      He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level\n  touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.\n  \"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said.\n      Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I\n  think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own\n  receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap\n  forward as might have been suitable.\"\n      The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach\n  29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.\n      NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first\n  quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.\n      Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of\n  between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while\n  growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.\n      Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some\n  economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the\n  dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more\n  competitive.\n      \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso\n  has already substantially devalued against all of the country's\n  trading partners,\" he said.\n      On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was\n  opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted\n  repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two\n  years after the imposition of the Code.\n      The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has\n  been delayed by objections from some business groups.\n      \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the\n  events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be\n  prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds\n  and I'm not about to do that,\" Fernandez said.\n      \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of\n  capital and earnings can be free,\" he said.\n      \"We have had one year of reasonably good results.

But officials noted that Poehl has worked\n  closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard\n  Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.\n      Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul\n  Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international\n  reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.\n      Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook\n  Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor\n  Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was\n  Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as\n  Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.\n      In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the\n  dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of\n  the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution\n  which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent\n  inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts\n  of galloping inflation this century.\n      But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and\n  inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe\n  to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the\n  dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.\n      \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the\n  dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the\n  Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark\n  would endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business\n  journalists in Frankfurt recently.\n      Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that\n  Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.\n      \"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not\n  focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external\n  economy,\" she said.\n      An economist at a German bank, who declined to be\n  identified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will\n  certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so\n  rigidly oriented towards money supply.\"\n      One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to\n  persuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For\n  Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that\n  the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise\n  currencies.\n      The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency\n  dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in\n  fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.\n      \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they\n  don't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of\n  intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates\n  round, making a speculator's position worthless.\n      Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist\n  in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.\n      A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over\n  a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.\n      He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and\n  play golf.\n      Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute\n  for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.\n      \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount\n  if you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers\n  are very professional and skilled. \"They've burnt the fingers of\n  many people,\" he said.

It said 1986\n  plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because\n  farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical\n  and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.\n      The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop\n  (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year\n  earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.\n      The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500\n  tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier\n  figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China\n  News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.\n      The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province\n  fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the\n  area under sugar was dropping.\n      \"Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,\" the newspaper\n  said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of\n  nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane\n  is a major problem.\"\n      A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,\n  south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in\n  area planted.\n      He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel\n  developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the\n  maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.\n      The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province\n  of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667\n  hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only\n  70 from one mu of sugarbeet.\n      The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to\n  4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.\n      Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed\n  with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in\n  falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.\n      The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the\n  official press has said.\n      Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of\n  sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.\n      The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln\n  tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.\n      A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks\n  in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import\n  sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986\n  when the central government resumed control of imports.\n      \"As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored\n  in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,\" the diplomat\n  said.\n      The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to\n  consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly\n  as coal had priority. \"How quickly they can move the sugar is\n  one factor determining import levels,\" he said.\n      Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,\n  China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.\n      \"China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about\n  152/153 dlrs a tonne,\" he added. \"China is not a desperate buyer\n  now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into\n  the open market.\"\n      A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding\n  imports was price.\n      \"While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,\n  foreign exchange restraints persist,\" he said.\n      The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five\n  pct a year but \"a communist government is in a much better\n  position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the\n  foreign exchange situation demands it.\"", "UAE TRADE, CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUSES NARROW\n  The United Arab Emirates recorded a\n  1986 trade surplus of 12.2 billion dirhams, narrowing from 30.2\n  billion in 1985, the central bank's latest bulletin shows.\n      The central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to\n  the decline in the value of exports and re-exports to 37.2\n  billion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985.

This would leave a budget deficit\n  before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of\n  GDP.\n      The government, having consistently overshot its own\n  spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a\n  credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the\n  budget, analysts said.\n      \"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\"\n  said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.\n      Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less\n  attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using\n  their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the\n  money and capital markets.\n      South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending\n  will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49\n  billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5\n  pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the\n  IMF.\n      \"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predicted\n  one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away\n  from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past\n  two years.\n      The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the\n  political situation and the onset of an economic crisis\n  triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over\n  loans to the country in September 1985.\n      Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling\n  per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,\n  government officials say economic growth is the prime\n  objective.\n      But private-sector economists caution that the government's\n  ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is\n  constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the\n  current account of the country's balance of payments.\n      Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5\n  billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the\n  nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an\n  arrangement reached earlier this year with major international\n  creditor banks.\n      Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has\n  little room to manoeuvre.\n      Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and\n  budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and\n  South African Transport Services suggest that major tax\n  concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.\n      Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions\n  for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only\n  election.

on imported energy, they would only lead\n  to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he\n  said.\n      This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high\n  prices, he added.\n      Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major\n  crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.", "BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY\n  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change\n  credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday\n  for its last session before the Venice summit, banking\n  economists and money market dealers said.\n      The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month\n  by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is\n  unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates\n  in the near future, they said.\n      The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will\n  be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.\n      But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was\n  usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and\n  did not necessarily herald any policy moves.\n      Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today\n  there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply\n  growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was\n  stable against the mark.\n      Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has\n  opened a representative office, that the West German economy\n  was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted\n  1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.\n      Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in\n  a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the\n  Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a\n  minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.\n      \"They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe\n  lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or\n  Lombard,\" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,\n  Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.\n      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said\n  German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and\n  around historical lows for West Germany.\n      A further cut in rates would have little impact on the\n  economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,\n  with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.\n      The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move\n  on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.\n  \"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,\" he said.\n      A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in\n  line with the new structure of money market rates since last\n  month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.\n      The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a\n  diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.\n      But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it\n  clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere \"eyewash.\"\n      Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to\n  cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary\n  policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.\n      But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax\n  cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget\n  deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.\n      \"The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in\n  Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,\"\n  said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.\n      Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before\n  Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. \"But I\n  don't expect any convincing measures,\" he said.\n      Money market dealers noted that call money continued to\n  normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday\n  and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by\n  month-end distortions.\n      Call money could come under upwards pressure later this\n  month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on\n  behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.\n  Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.\n      Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds\n  tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55\n  pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,\n  and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.\n      But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would\n  allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55.

Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains\n  subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat\n  and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs\n  and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.\n      House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has\n  said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.\n      But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to\n  be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and\n  a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said\n  freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major\n  grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget\n  savings Glickman claims.\n      Another area where Glickman and other have said budget\n  savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,\n  ARP, levels for wheat and corn.\n      However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand\n  within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop\n  wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30\n  pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most\n  commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.\n      Congressional sources said the only way to achieve\n  significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost\n  the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said\n  singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as\n  unfair to one commodity.\n      Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most\n  likely to eventually look for budget savings are some\n  tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible \n  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.\n      Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion\n  but not enough, they said.\n      Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture\n  committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on\n  all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price\n  support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the\n  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.\n      This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau\n  Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.", "U.S. FIRST TIME JOBLESS CLAIMS ROSE IN WEEK\n  New applications for unemployment\n  insurance benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 340,000 in the\n  week ended June 6 from 310,000 in the prior week, the Labor\n  Department said.\n      The number of people actually receiving benefits under\n  regular state programs totaled 2,359,000 in the week ended May\n  30, the latest period for which that figure was available.\n      That was up from 2,255,000 the previous week.", "OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS\n  Some OPEC states are unhappy about the\n  prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose\n  great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price\n  and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.\n      They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference\n  presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances\n  about price differentials making some of their crudes\n  uncompetitive.\n      There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that\n  OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,\n  to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.\n      But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price\n  differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market\n  signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.\n      \"All OPEC members can make a good case for changing\n  differentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"But\n  at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave well\n  alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\"\n      Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw\n  sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished\n  customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,\n  marketing incentives have helped their sales.\n      Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by\n  means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside\n  better priced grades in a \"package.\"\n      Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least\n  for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should\n  change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for\n  fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At\n  its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed\n  prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference\n  point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985\n  when members offered discounts to attract customers.\n      OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8\n  mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter\n  and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend\n  or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.\n      Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not\n  mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr\n  target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,\n  analysts say.\n      The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one\n  non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export\n  crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.\n  Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.\n      Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil\n  exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say\n  only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at\n  official prices, with some of the rest included in processing\n  or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.\n      Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,\n  when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to\n  pay the new prices.\n     Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude\n  -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --\n  was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.\n      In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below\n  its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,\n  due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has\n  risen.\n      Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say\n  its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.\n      But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort\n  Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the\n  differentials question in Vienna.\n      \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which\n  holds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.", "NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE\n  Analysts said they were surprised at\n  the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for\n  fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy\n  statements and positive for the economy.\n      Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus\n  for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs\n  against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.\n      Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus\n  was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'\n  forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.\n      Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters\n  before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a\n  2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.\n      The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and\n  the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,\n  the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite\n  lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more\n  confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.\n      However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying\n  the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will\n  move lower.\n      The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after\n  hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget\n  release.\n      Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share\n  market, despite an increase in the contribution of company\n  taxation to revenue figures.\n      One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus\n  announcement could push the share market up by 50 points\n  tomorrow.\n      The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a\n  continuation of existing policies, and the absence of\n  traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively\n  by overseas investors, another said.\n      But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax\n  avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share\n  market, particularly multi-national companies.\n      The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,\n  through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The\n  requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln\n  N.Z.

The strength of the economy and broad money\n  growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near\n  term,\" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.\n      Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's\n  mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies\n  said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.\n  Rates.\n      It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that\n  a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such\n  optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which\n  mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's\n  strength.\n      The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm\n  about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment\n  rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly\n  replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying\n  average earnings in April, dealers said.\n      The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending\n  rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank\n  of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset\n  the impact on domestic money supply of its current\n  intervention.\n      \"The gilt market reaction was correct,\" said Bill Martin,\n  chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.\n      \"That's very important ...

In 1990 the Community's \"standstill\"\n  agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then\n  feel the full impact of its enlargement.\n      The Commission has proposed several cost and production\n  cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum\n  guaranteed quantity system, he added.\n      Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer\n  prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700\n  Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe\n  said.\n      Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory\n  amount when market prices are below or above this level.\n      He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory\n  amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural\n  Policy's oils and fats regime.\n      \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the\n  proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete\n  or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said.\n      Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General\n  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.\n      It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied\n  to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed\n  it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.\n      EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do\n  under present aid arrangements, he said.\n      The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC\n  produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities\n  imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,\n  Tanghe said.\n      The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'\n  requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall\n  effect would stabilise Community production levels without\n  affecting demand, he said.\n      It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current\n  import levels, he said.\n      Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are\n  imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals\n  requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.\n  Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported\n  beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.", "UNION PACIFIC &lt;UNP> RAISES CRUDE OIL PRICES\n  Union Pacific Resources, formerly\n  Champlin Petroleum, said it raised posted prices for crude oil\n  by 50 cts a barrel, effective yesterday.\n      The price increase brings West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.\n  benchmark grade, to 19.00 dlrs a barrel.\n      The posted price increase follows a similar move by several\n  other oil companies.\n      Sun Co was the first to raise crude oil postings yesterday\n  afternoon and today many other companies are following.\n      The last price increase made by oil companies was around\n  May 22.", "VaALIAN BALANCE OF PAYMENTS IN DEFICIT IN MAY\n  Italy's overall balance of payments showed\n  a deficit of 3,211 billion lire in May compared with a surplus\n  of 2,040 billion in April, provisional Bank of Italy figures\n  show.\n      The May deficit compares with a surplus of 1,555 billion\n  lire in the corresponding month of 1986.\n      For the first five months of 1987, the overall balance of\n  payments showed a surplus of 299 billion lire against a deficit\n  of 2,854 billion in the corresponding 1986 period.", "ITALIAN NET OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL IN MAY\n  Italy's net official reserves fell to\n  67,110 billion lire in May from a previously reported 68,455\n  billion in April, the Bank of Italy said.\n      Gold holdings totalled 35,243 billion lire at end May,\n  unchanged from end April.\n      Convertible currencies totalled 18,277 billion lire in May,\n  down from 20,028 billion in April, while European Currency Unit\n  holdings were 10,610 billion against 10,528 billion.", "BECOR WESTERN &lt;BCW>AGAIN ADJOURNS HOLDER MEETING\n  Becor Western Inc said its\n  reconvened shareholders meeting has been adjourned to 1000 CDT\n  June 30.\n      The company had previously announced plans to again adjourn\n  the meeting following receipt of a renewed offer from Lynch\n  Corp &lt;LGL> yesterday.\n      The meeting was originally convened on June four when\n  shareholders approved the sale of Becor's Western Gear Corp\n  subsidiary before adjourning.

But with the current mineral export tax level being\n  levied, a net loss is likely to be registered.\n      ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared\n  with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.\n      Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in\n  1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as\n  the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over\n  two to the dollar.\n      But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the\n  auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,\n  and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic\n  strategy based on national resources.\n      ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the\n  break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.\n      \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will\n  affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare\n  under the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations\n  and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.\n      Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange\n  rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export\n  profits.\n      \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even\n  point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick\n  Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.\n      High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian\n  industry.\n      Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69\n  cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States\n  and under 40 cents in Chile.\n      The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia\n  being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had\n  stopped sBending copper south through South Africa.\n      Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are\n  sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while\n  5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.\n  Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and\n  fuel.", "RIO DE JANEIRO DOCKERS STRIKE OVER WAGES\n  Rio de Janeiro's 3,500\n  dockworkers went on strike for an indefinite period today to\n  demand wage increases, a spokesman for the dockers said.\n      The Rio dockers did not get support from their colleagues\n  in Santos, Brazil's main port, but the spokesman said they\n  would not return to work unless their demands were met.\n      Earlier this week, some 65,000 dockworkers cancelled a\n  scheduled national strike to pressure port officials to give\n  them a wage increase and other benefits.\n      A Rio port spokesman said the halt would cause daily losses\n  of about 100,000 U.S. dlrs.", "FLUOR &lt;FLR> WINS GENERAL ELECTRIC &lt;GE> CONTRACT\n  Fluor Corp said it won a contract\n  with General Electric to design, construct and deliver modules\n  for a methyl chloride process addition.\n      The value of the contract was not disclosed.\n      Fluor said its Applied Engineering Co unit will construct\n  28 modular sections and deliver them to GE's Waterford, N.Y.\n  Silicone Products division plant.\n      Methyl chloride is an integral part of silicone production.", "KELLEY OIL &lt;KLY> BUYING OIL PROPERTIES\n  Kelley Oil and Gas Partners Ltd said it\n  has agreed to purchase all of CF Industries Inc's oil and\n  natural gas properties for about 5,500,000 dlrs, effective July\n  1.\n      It said the Louisiana properties had proven reserves at\n  year-end of 11 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 85,000\n  barrels of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.\n      Kelley said it currently owns working interests in some of\n  the properties.", "TANZANIA RAISES FUEL PRICES,TAXES IN 1987/8 BUDGET\n  The Tanzanian government, in its\n  second annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery\n  program inspired by the International Monetary Fund, announced\n  increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on\n  government services.\n      Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said the government expected\n  to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8,\n  39 pct more than this year's estimate.

growth in net exports will\n  merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and\n  other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its\n  latest economic report.\n      Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,\n  after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will\n  contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.\n      As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5\n  pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,\n  the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.\n      \"Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop\n  dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause\n  a falloff in the growth of disposable income,\" Van Dyke said.\n      Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8\n  pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.\n      The report was released before the Commerce Department\n  reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,\n  after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal\n  consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with\n  a 0.6 pct increase the month before.\n      The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost\n  consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9\n  pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.\n      This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income \n  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.\n      As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power\n  of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs\n  this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.\n      The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing\n  starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in\n  1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.\n      \"For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988\n  or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,\" Van Dyke said.\n      Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an\n  improvement in trade. \"However, with protectionist attitudes on\n  the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,\" he\n  added.", "BROOKLYN UNION&lt;BU> SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE\n  Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas\n  utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of\n  Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to\n  transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.\n      Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the\n  United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or\n  non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot\n  supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,\n  analysts said.\n      Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing\n  pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South\n  closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has\n  relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.\n       In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs\n  per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas\n  costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.\n      Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open\n  access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear\n  of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.\n      Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for\n  gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.\n      Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of\n  supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a\n  Brooklyn Union official said.\n      Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\n  most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through\n  to rate payers.\n      While net effect on the company will not be known for\n  several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,\n  end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,\n  will end up paying more for gas, he said.\n      Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas\n  demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be\n  small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin\n  Jenrette, said.\n      If the situation persists into winter heating season, high\n  cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.\n      Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for\n  spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,\n  Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost\n  factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with\n  end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering\n  firm, said.\n      \"But these companies are not unwitting victims of the\n  take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,\" he said.\n      Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request\n  for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility\n  for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.\n      Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will\n  threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to\n  alternative fuels, he said.\n      In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the\n  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being\n  negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.\n      Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas\n  for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory\n  on the inventory charge, he said.\n      \"Cool heads will prevail,\" DLJ's Launer said, \" but it may\n  take a while.\"", "REYNOLDS METALS &lt;RLM> TO RESTART IDLE POTLINE\n  Reynolds Metals co said it plans\n  to restart the last idle potuction line at its

Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in\n  November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.\n      \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and\n  more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands\n  to make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson\n  Lehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to\n  describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling\n  takeover target.\n      Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon\n  gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through\n  November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per\n  share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of\n  three yesterday.\n      The agreement would be calculated on the basis of\n  Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a\n  split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other\n  company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262\n  mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen\n  returned telephone calls seeking comment.\n      \"Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if\n  someone else takes over Gillette,\" said Analyst Deepak Raj of\n  Merrill Lynch and Co. \"I'm not saying that is going to happen\n  but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45\n  dlrs per share.\"\n      Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons\n  why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring\n  Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon\n  private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two\n  years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's\n  operations. \"He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of\n  the dearptment store business.\" Another reason is that Revlon\n  has recently made two other acquisitions.\n      Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if\n  some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble\n  Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.\n      Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for\n  Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,\n  RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston\n  Purina Co &lt;RAL>.\n      \"Perelman is trying to put the company in play,\" said a\n  Wall Street arbitrageur. \"He gets to share in the upside if the\n  company is sold.\" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette\n  to resist Perelman's overture. \"I can't see the board\n  consenting, what has changed between November and now,\" he\n  said.", "Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.\n  \"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of\n  calculation,\" he said.

They just can't say no or they'll be sued by\n  shareholders.\" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,\n  three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.\n      According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by\n  Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger\n  agreement without any financing condition.

It said the\n  rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly\n  higher than in the first half of this year.\n      The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated\n  somewhat during the early months of 1987. \n      Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory\n  adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation\n  has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to\n  reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.\n      The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand\n  pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are\n  likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.\n      The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for\n  the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six\n  months.

As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will\n  rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in\n  1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.\n      The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion\n  yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand\n  and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the\n  measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite\n  possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have\n  worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.\n      The OECD outlook said, \"Continued large current account\n  surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial\n  net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure\n  on the yen.\" It said that further appreciation could then lead\n  manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus\n  weaken domestic growth.\n      The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to\n  gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct\n  growth.

Belgian inflation could\n  stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus\n  will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.\n      While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming\n  its borrowing requirement, \"it will probably be insufficient to\n  check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,\" the OECD said.\n      In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5\n  pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming\n  less competitive and imports rising. \"Employment is forecast to\n  decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the\n  private sector and budgetary cuts,\" the report said.\n      Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987\n  and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining\n  domestic gas prices.\n      Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster\n  growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in\n  wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year.", "SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH\n  Strong growth in domestic demand was a key\n  feature of the economies of southern European countries in\n  1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the\n  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.\n      In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total\n  domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to\n  five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth\n  restrained private consumption.\n      Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and\n  domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected\n  to be halved to five pct next year.\n      In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,\n  had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross\n  Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption\n  were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain\n  strong.\n      The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply\n  next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European\n  Community and declining competitiveness.\n      In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards\n  following an increase early this year linked with the\n  introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due\n  to cold weather.", "OECD SAYS HIGH WAGE DEALS HARMING NORDIC STATES\n  High wage settlements in Nordic countries\n  threaten to cut exports and reduce the international\n  competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for\n  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.\n      In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in\n  early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration\n  in competitiveness.

U.S. Lenders,\n  mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low\n  as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their\n  portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to\n  induce them to retain their accounts.\n      As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were\n  forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose\n  rates would move in line with the cost of funds.\n      \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\"\n  said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,\n  explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only\n  offering variable rate mortgages.\n      The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped\n  homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders\n  concede they are being forced to undercut each other still\n  more.\n      Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier\n  this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by\n  National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for\n  new business, officials at all three institutions said.\n      The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even\n  below those on the variable rate loans.\n      \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variable\n  rate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which\n  earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate\n  new mortgage loans.\n      But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable\n  loans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to our\n  mortgage product.\"\n      Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed\n  rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.\n      The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was\n  exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.\n      \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, noting\n  that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct\n  of its 1986 volume.\n      In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they\n  offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest\n  rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the\n  lender is earning an above average return on assets.\n      But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won\n  the benefit of cheap money.\n      Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed\n  rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption\n  that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates\n  fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.\n      Young explained that the company had planned to protect\n  itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a\n  complicated hedging instrument.\n      But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations\n  and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He\n  said money market rates were too high to arrange both the\n  mortgages and hedge profitably.\n      However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does\n  make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This\n  means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond\n  and selling them to an investor.\n      For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more\n  efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate\n  mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular\n  again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money\n  over the past few years.", "TEXACO &lt;TXC> CANADA TO RAISE CRUDE OIL POSTINGS\n  Texaco Inc's Texaco Canada said it\n  will raise  postings for its Edmonton/Swann Hills crude by 24\n  canadian cts a barrel, effective June 20.\n      The company said the new posting for Edmonton/Swann Hills\n  will be 25.60 dlrs a barrel.

That is its\n  highest level since January 1986.\n      OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's\n  oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to\n  be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production\n  agreement may only need a slight review.\n      Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation\n  of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to\n  a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.\n      Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon\n  after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased\n  tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices\n  should begin easing.\n      \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed\n  to in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a\n  vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.\n      OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at\n  18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to\n  16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln\n  barrels in the fourth quarter.\n      This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising\n  from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.\n      Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,\n  Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a\n  reduction in output.\n      \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to\n  trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that\n  OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman\n  Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.\n      But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such\n  as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.\n      \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the\n  official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are\n  committed to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua,\n  analyst with L.F. Rothschild.\n      However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting\n  in September to re-evaluate market conditions.\n      Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the\n  fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a\n  day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000\n  barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president\n  of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.\n      Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this\n  meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to\n  offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated\n  throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,\n  producers receive less money for their oil.\n      \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\"\n  said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.\n      \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to\n  produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act\n  as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two\n  dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he\n  said.\n      One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.\n      \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian\n  Gulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache\n  Securites.\n      Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been\n  regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration\n  is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the\n  U.S. flag, with naval escorts.\n      \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis\n  like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that\n  could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.", "N.Y.

But our proposal\n  leaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said.\n      \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not\n  reflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formula\n  builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost\n  everyone.\"\n      Although full implications of the new formula have still to\n  be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as\n  Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly\n  higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El\n  Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.\n      Because the proposal provides that future quota\n  distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it\n  should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing\n  so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.\n      \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least\n  a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the\n  September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a\n  new quota formula, \" van Horick said.\n      At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.\n      \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side.

The price gyrations have\n  combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented\n  volatility to some U.S. securities markets.\n      At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some\n  lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate\n  takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers\n  steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.\n      And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign\n  exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork\n  for an international securities marketplace in which trading\n  occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.\n      Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment\n  opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce\n  U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.\n      Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial\n  disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,\n  eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to\n  spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's\n  review of hostile corporate takeovers.\n      Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton\n  investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to\n  the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.\n      In line with the views of other top administration\n  officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover\n  battles over new federal regulations.\n      The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider\n  trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that\n  topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the\n  administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\n      Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with\n  Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to\n  significantly alter the commission's current priorities.\n      The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them\n  lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that\n  figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the\n  agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.\n      The agency is one of the few in the government that\n  actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past\n  few years because of fees it charges public companies,\n  investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.\n      The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,\n  meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the\n  president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing\n  for policy differences alone.\n      By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same\n  political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request\n  each year instead of leaving this to the White House.\n      Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins\n  to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed\n  in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted\n  market manipulations by large investment firms.\n      The agency requires public companies and investment\n  vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on\n  their financial condition and to disclose changes in their\n  condition any time they issue new securities.\n      It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to\n  register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and\n  it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.\n      Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial\n  magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to\n  become the nation's 35th president.\n      Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served\n  from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in\n  1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's\n  first term and was Reagan's director of the Central\n  Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.", "U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES\n  The Administration asked Congress to\n  replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it\n  into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade\n  Representative Clayton Yeutter said.\n      The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more\n  accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when\n  the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.\n      Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is\n  called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet\n  the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they\n  should pay about the same rates of duties.\n      Yeutter said, \"American exporters will find it far easier to\n  deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of\n  differing systems which they now face.\"\n      He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational\n  negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.\n      Yeutter said government and business moves are based on\n  data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve\n  knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.\n      He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under\n  the new system, with about half expected to join the system by\n  January 1988.", "SERVICE RESOURCES&lt;SRC> UNIT CUTS SORG&lt;SRG> STAKE\n  A group led by Chas.
